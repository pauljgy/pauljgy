## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

![My intimidating github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=pauljgy)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some degree. Hope to figure out which one soon.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make pleasing graphics with python libraries; soon, my research involving regressions of steak cooking conditions will be presented. I hope they will be well done. I have taken every measure to see that my work is a cut above the rest. :)
