![My intimidating github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=pauljgy)

- Currently working on some degree. Hope to figure out which one soon.
- ðŸŒ± Learning how to make pleasing graphics with python libraries; soon, my research for ideal steak cooking conditions will be presented. I hope they will be well done. My work will be a cut above the rest.
