## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

![My intimidating github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=pauljgy)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some degree. Hope to figure out which one soon.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make pleasing graphics with python libraries; soon, my research for ideal steak cooking conditions will be presented. I hope they will be well done. My work will be cut above the rest.
