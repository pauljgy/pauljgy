## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

![My intimidating github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=pauljgy)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on basic quantitative trading projects. Algorithms, probabilities, Bayes' rule, and whatnot.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make pleasing graphics with python libraries; soon, my research involving regressions of steak cooking conditions will be presented. I hope for these graphics to be well done. :)
